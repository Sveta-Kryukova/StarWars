# Description
This is a simple yet feature-rich React Native-Expo app for Star Wars fans. The app presents a list of all characters with their name, date of birth, gender, home planet, and species. You can click on a character's name to view their detailed description. Additionally, the app offers a search functionality that allows you to find a character by their name. You can also sort the names in alphabetical or reverse order.

The app comes with three counters that keep track of the number of characters you like based on their gender. When you click on the heart icon next to a character, the counters will increment or decrement accordingly. Moreover, the app features a clear fans button that can be used to reset all counters.

Overall, this app offers a fun and interactive experience for Star Wars enthusiasts, with a clean and user-friendly interface.
